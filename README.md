# Census Explorer
# Problem Statement:
This project explores the 1994 Census database to identify trends and insights that could inform policy decisions.

    What is the demographic breakdown of the population by race?
    What is the average age of men in the workforce?
    What percentage of individuals hold a Bachelor's degree or higher?
    How does education level impact earning potential?
    What is the minimum number of hours worked per week, and what percentage of individuals earn more than $50,000 in this category?
    Which country has the highest percentage of individuals earning more than $50,000, and what is that percentage?
    What is the most common occupation among high-earners in India?

Solution:
Using Pandas, I extracted and analyzed the relevant data from the 1994 Census database. The code is included in this repository and demonstrates my ability to:

    Clean and manipulate large datasets
    Perform statistical analysis and data visualization
    Extract insights and trends from complex data

Technologies Used:

    Pandas
    Python 3.12.3
    Jupyter notebook
    VS Code
